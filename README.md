Technologies Implemented:
Cabling: Correct cabling techniques will be employed to ensure reliable connectivity between networking devices.
Basic Device Settings: Devices will be configured with essential settings such as hostname, IP addresses, and gateway for seamless communication within the network.
VLANs: Virtual LANs will be implemented to logically segment the network, enhancing security and optimizing network traffic.
Subnetting and IP Addressing: Subnetting will be utilized to efficiently allocate IP addresses and manage network resources.
Inter-VLAN Routing: Multilayer switches will be configured with Switch Virtual Interface (SVI) to enable communication between different VLANs.
DHCP Server: A dedicated DHCP server will be configured to dynamically assign IP addresses to network devices, simplifying network management.
SSH: Secure Shell (SSH) will be configured to provide secure remote access to network devices, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of data transmission.
NAT Overload (PAT): Port Address Translation (PAT) will be configured for NAT Overload, enabling multiple private IP addresses to be mapped to a single public IP address for internet access.
Switchport Security: Port security measures will be implemented on Finance department switch to prevent unauthorized access and enhance network security.
Wireless Network: Integration of  Access Point will provide wireless connectivity, enhancing mobility and flexibility for network users.
ISP Routers: Routers connecting to Internet Service Providers (ISPs) will be configured to establish external connectivity and enable internet access for the network.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, the network design offers a comprehensive solution tailored to meet the communication and connectivity needs of the business company. By implementing a hierarchical network architecture with advanced features like VLANs, DHCP, and NAT Overload, we ensure seamless operations and efficient resource utilization. Additionally, measures such as SSH for secure remote access and port security enhance network security, safeguarding sensitive data. With this robust network infrastructure in place, the business company is well-equipped to navigate the challenges of the digital age and support its ongoing growth and success.
